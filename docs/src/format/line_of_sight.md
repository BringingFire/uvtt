# line_of_sight (array)

An list of lists of coordinates. Each sublist contains elements describing the points on a path that correspond to structures on the map that should block line of sight and light sources, such as walls.

## Example

```json
"line_of_sight": [
	[
		{
			"x": 2,
			"y": 4.5
		},
		{
			"x": 2,
			"y": 2
		},
		{
			"x": 8,
			"y": 2
		},
	]
]
```
